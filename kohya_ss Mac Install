# Installing Kohya_ss on MacBook Pro M1

## Prerequisites
Before installing Kohya_ss, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed on your system.

### 1. Install Homebrew
If you haven’t installed Homebrew yet, open Terminal and run:
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Then, add Homebrew to your PATH:
```sh
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install essential packages using Homebrew:
```sh
brew install git cmake protobuf
```

### 3. Install Python (Recommended: Miniconda)
Miniconda is recommended for managing Python environments:
```sh
brew install --cask miniconda
```
Then, initialize Conda:
```sh
conda init zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```
Create a Python environment:
```sh
conda create -n kohya python=3.10 -y
conda activate kohya
```

## Installing Kohya_ss

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, ensure `pip` is up-to-date:
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```
Then install the required dependencies:

### 3. Install PyTorch
Since MacBook M1 uses Apple Silicon, install PyTorch with MPS support:

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### 4. Verify Installation
Run the following command to check if Kohya_ss is installed correctly:
```sh
python ./kohya_gui.py
```

```sh
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
- Ensure you are using Python 3.10
- Try reinstalling dependencies: `pip install --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt`
- Check for compatibility issues with the latest versions
